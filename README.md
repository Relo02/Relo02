## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a Robotics Systems and Control Engineer

I'm passionate about **robot perception**, **autonomous control systems**, and **machine learning**. I work at the intersection of software, control theory, and intelligent behavior for real-world robotic systems.

### ðŸš€ Current Projects

- ðŸ”§ **Model Predictive Control (MPC) for FALCO Autonomous Drone**  
  Developing an MPC-based control system to enable precise and adaptive flight control for the FALCO drone platform.

- ðŸ¤– **Leonardo Drone Contest â€“ Autonomous Robotics Challenge**  
  Participating in the Leonardo Drone Contest organized by *Leonardo S.p.A.*, focused on multi-agent autonomous navigation in environments with known and unknown obstacles.  
  Contributions include:
  - Path planning and real-time obstacle avoidance for a drone and ground robot.
  - Vision-based detection using **YOLO** and **ArUco markers**.
  - PTZ camera integration for **QR code recognition**, enabling coordinated task execution between agents.

- ðŸ§  **Reinforcement Learning for Robotics**  
  Exploring the use of RL algorithms to develop control systems that learn optimal actions through interaction, reducing reliance on uncertain or incomplete models.

### ðŸ’¡ Interests
- Autonomous systems and robot navigation  
- Vision-based perception and object detection
- Machine Learning architectures for computer vision (NN, CNN)
- Learning-based control (e.g., RL, imitation learning)  
- Multi-agent systems and coordination  

Let's connect and build the future of robotics!
